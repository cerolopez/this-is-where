## Project Objective
We were tasked with creating a web app using React, Node, Express, MongoDB, and HTML. It also required us to perform CRUD operations on at least 2 Mongo collections, implement at least 3 React components using hooks, and generate 1,000 synthetic records.

We decided to create an app where people can share a sentiment that is connected to a place in time in the SF Bay Area. The user can choose between a variety of post formats, such as a missed connection, a memory, a love letter, a postcard, or a compliment, to encourage people to write positive things and be creative. For example, a user could share a funny memory with their classmates that took place in November 2022 at the Philz on Middlefield in Palo Alto. They could add a date and a city to the post, along with a more detailed description about the location, and then the post itself. Other users can browse these posts, upvote posts, filter by a variety of categories (e.g., city, date, user, post type), and favorite posts that they like. Users will also have the ability to flag inappropriate posts.

## Tech requirements
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB
